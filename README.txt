Imagine that I produce a graphical model in MATLAB using Object Oriented Programming. In the next step I optimized this system using Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning. As you can see the system is so slow a system. 
My system configuration (Lenovo Ideapad Z500 Laptop (Core i5 3rd Gen/4 GB/1 TB/Windows 8/1/ Windows 8)) is so weak and each iteration will take quite a bit of my RAM, so this Simulation cannot run faster than this in my computer. I ran this system in another powerful system in it had a better speed of running. I implemented a Traffic Model using Object Oriented Programming and we can Easily change the number of cars, angle of the streets, and number of streets. Also, I optimize this Urban area's traffic timing using Reinforcement Learning. 
The system is running. you can see that the traffic lights change their modes some of them that were in red light now are green, and some others are in red. It is important to know that we optimized the wasting time of all passengers. We used a cost function that optimized a cooperated system includes multi agent System (MAS), so we optimized this plant to have a Cooperated traffic light optimization in this model.
